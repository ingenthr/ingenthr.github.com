      <h1>memcached Virtual Appliance</h1>

      <p>The virtual appliance is just a simple memcached server with
      some additional tools accessible through a browser.</p>

      <p>The username to log in is "memcached" and the default password
      is "vappmemc".  The root password is also "vappmemc" and there is
      a shell script in root's home directory to change the password
      to access the tools through the web interface.</p>

      <h2>Use with VMWare</h2>
      <p>Not all VMWare tools can directly import Open Virtualization 
      Format (OVF) based virtual appliances.  To address this, VMWare has
      made <a href="http://www.vmware.com/appliances/learn/ovf.html">
      VMWare OVF Tool</a> available for download.  This image has been
      tested to import into VMWare after being converted with VMWare's
      OVF tool.  The image has been prepared with a SCSI controller
      to be compatible with servers.  Some versions of VMWare will 
      automatically map the disk image to an IDE controller if it does
      not support SCSI.  In that case, the disk image does still 
      work correctly.</p>

      <h3>Additional Configuration</h3>

      <p>By default, the image will configure itself via DHCP.  It is 
      recommended that you configure your DHCP server with a specific, 
      known IP address for the MAC address you have configured to the 
      system.  Alternatively, you may configure it for a static IP by
      <a 
      href="http://docs.sun.com/app/docs/doc/819-2240/nwamd-1m?a=view">following
      these directions</a> to configure a specific IP address.  Note 
      the default interface for this image is "e1000g0".</p>
