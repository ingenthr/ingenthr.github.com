      <h1>memcached Virtual Appliance</h1>

      <p>NorthScale has produced a memcached Virtual Appliance Image
      for use on virtualization platforms like VMWare server or any 
      compatible system supporting the OVF format.  It will automatically
      start a memcached server listening on the standard port and
      use most of the system's memory for memcached.</p>

      <p>Addtionally, there are some tools which allow developers and 
      system administrators to observe memcached operations.  You can
      access the tools by pointing your browser to the built in web 
      server.  For more details, see the <a href="help.html">online
      help</a>.</p>

      <p>There is no cost associated with this virtual appliance.
      We would appreciate your
      <a href="mailto:feedback@northscale.com">feedback</a> on
      the utility you receive from this appliance.  We have intentionally
      kept it simple, but if there is something you would like or need
      to be able to use these, please
      <a href="mailto:feedback@northscale.com">let us know</a>.</p>

      <p>To create this, we downloaded the latest stable release of
      memcached from <a href="http://memcached.org">memcached.org</a>,
      built and tested memcached, and then integrated its startup into
      the image.  When the appliance boots, it will automatically use nearly all
      of its memory for memcached.  </p>

      <p>In most cases, there is no reason to log into the image.  Just
      launch it and point your client to port 11211 (either TCP or UDP).
      If you want to see the extra tools, make sure there are no firewalls
      preventing you from accessing port 80, then point your browser at the 
      hostname or IP address for the machine.
      Do be cautious about security settings for the
      memcached port, as memcached does not
      have an authentication mechanism.</p>
