      <p>There is no additional cost over that of running your own
      AMI.  We would appreciate your
      <a href="mailto:feedback@northscale.com">feedback</a> on
      the utility you receive from these AMIs.  We have intentionally
      kept it simple, but if there is something you would like or need
      to be able to use these, please
      <a href="mailto:feedback@northscale.com">let us know</a>.</p>

      <p>To create these, we downloaded the latest stable release of
      memcached from <a href="http://memcached.org">memcached.org</a>,
      built and tested memcached, and then integrated its startup into
      the image.  When the AMI boots, it will automatically use nearly all
      of its memory for memcached.  The "with-tools" instances have some
      browser based tools which allow you observe what the memcached 
      instance is doing.</p>

      <p>In most cases, there is no reason to log into the image.  Just
      launch it and point your client to port 11211 (either TCP or UDP).
      If you want to see the extra tools, make sure your security group
      allows you to get to port 80, and point your browser at the public
      DNS name for the instance.
      Do be cautious about your security group settings on EC2 for the
      memcached port, as memcached does not
      have an authentication mechanism.</p>
